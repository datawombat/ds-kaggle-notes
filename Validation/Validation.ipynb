    "#### 1. Random/rowwise split\n",
    "    - Rows are independent of each other.\n",
    "    - Feature generation can be hard to find, and I guess it will require some practice.  \n",
    "#### 2. Time-based/timewise split\n",
    "    - When the first chunk is TRAIN and the rest is TEST\n",
    "    - For example, when we are to predict customers for each dat in the day week.\n",
    "    - Competitions: Rossmann, BIMBO, ...\n",
    "#### 3. By id\n",
    "    - When the TRAIN/TEST split is done on some ID, which can be a category ID, country ID, etc.\n",
    "    - IDs might be hidden from us.\n",
    "    - For example, users of a certain category might be on TRAIN and of another category on TEST. That means, users don't overlap because of their category. \n",
    "![](images/overlap.jpg)    \n",
    "    - Competitions: Intel & mobileODT cervical cancer screening, the nature concervancy, ...\n",

    "- Leaderboard(LB) score is consistently higher or lower than validation score.\n",
    "- Leaderboard(LB) score is not correlated with validation score at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reasons for low scores\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We may have **different scores in Kfold validation**, so we can correct it locally.\n",
    "2. **We don't mimic the organizer's TRAIN/TEST split** at all.\n",
    "3. **Too little data in PUBLIC TEST**. Then, your score might increase when the PRIVATE part is revealed.\n",
    "4. TRAIN and TEST are from **different distributions**. Then, you can adjust your solution during the training step, or perhaps it can be solved only by adjusting it to the LB, which is called **LEADERBOARD PROBING**. I may cover this after.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Leaderboard Shuffle problems\n",
    "\n",
    "After a LB shuffle someone like the competitor in position 3 could get from position \"389\" on the PUBLIC learboard to position 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/shuffle.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to expect it?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because of randomness. When data is highly unpredictable, many people could **overfit**.\n",
    "2. Little amount of data.\n",
    "3. Different public and private distributions."
